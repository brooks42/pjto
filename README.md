## FAQs

**Q: If I control an evolved Togetic and spend mana to cast a spell, do I draw a card?**

**Q: Can I pay life to cast Destiny Bond when I overload it?**

**A**: No, paying life to cast Destiny Bond is an alternate casting cost, as is overload. You can only choose one alternate casting cost.

**Q: Can I use Hidden Power to cast a spell using its Evolve From cost?**

**A**: No, casting a spell without paying its mana cost is an alternate cost, as is Evolve From. You can only choose one alternate casting cost.

**Q: If I have Magcargo evolved onto Slugma, and Magcargo dies, can I return Slugma to the battlefield with the death trigger?**

**A**: No, Slugma and Magcargo are the same object on the battlefield when evolved, and the ability tracks that when they go to the graveyard. Returning a different card will still trigger and return Slugma.
